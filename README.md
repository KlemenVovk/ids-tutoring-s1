# IDS tutoring session 1 - live demo

You are working on a slightly modified version of the [Goodreads books dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks) from Kaggle.

The main goal is to show common pitfalls you may run into while working with data you get at IDS. The emphasis of this session isn't on the value provided by doing data analysis, but on making sure your work is reproducible, discovering and resolving edge-cases and anomalies in your data, and some general advice for data wrangling and drawing pretty graphs.
